# Smart-File
## Description
The goal for this project is to use retrieval augmented generation (RAG) in order to provide context-aware answers to file-specific questions. Users are able to upload their file, ask a question, and receive a personalized response. Smart File is being built with Spring Boot.

## Current Progress
Smart File is currently a locally hosted web application to which users can upload files and search for keywords. Using Elasticsearch, Smart File is able to return relevant pages.
