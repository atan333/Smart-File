# Smart-File
## Description
The goal for this project is to use retrieval augmented generation (RAG) in order to provide context-aware answers to file-specific questions. Users are able to upload their file, ask a question, and receive a personalized response. Smart File is being built with Spring Boot.

## Current Progress
Smart File is currently a locally hosted web application to which users can upload files. My next step is to use iText and parse through the text in the uploaded PDF. Future goals include learning React.js to improve the user experience and hosting externally.
